Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches.
Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.
Agile software development refers to software development methodologies centered round the idea of iterative development,
where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams.
Scrum and Kanban are two of the most widely used Agile methodologies.
