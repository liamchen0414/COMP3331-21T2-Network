         North of 53. A magic phrase. Spoken, mumbled or thought
     inwardly by thousands of souls venturing northward. An
     imaginary line, shown only on maps and labelled 53 degrees.
     It's presence indicated to highway travellers by road side
     signs.
          Travellers and writers, poets and pilots, have
     contributed to the lore of the north. The rigors of life in
     the bush are told in tales of man eating mosquitoes, of
     murderous hordes of black flies, of the lumps of flesh
     carried away by the giant bull dog flies.
